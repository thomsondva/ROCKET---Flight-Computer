# ROCKET---Flight-Computer
I am building small rockets and i am also building software for it



--- TUTORIAL ---

you need to get MAC address of both esp-32 and write it into so like into ground(esp that stays on ground) esp-32 script you implement MAC address of the esp-32 inside the rocket and for the rocket esp-32 you do the same thing just reversed so grounds esp-32 MAC address into rocket esp script and than you just connect the ground esp to notebook or any computer and download the python dashboard script into that computer. Then close any arduino ide or any other program that could connect to the esp32 or open any COM ports and than when blue led will light on ground esp you can turn rocket esp32 power on and you should be able to see altitude graph and other things and dont worry the first 2 minutes of rocket esp it wont be counting with parachute or peak altitude cause its in preparation stage you can see that in the dashboard when the parachute armed controll light is green it means that it can push the servo to open parachute also the apogge detection system works that after the preparation stage whenever peak altitude goes below 4 meters it is counted as it is going down and will release parachute.
